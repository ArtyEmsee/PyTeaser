{"name":"Pyteaser","tagline":"Summarizes news articles by providing an url","body":"PyTeaser\r\n========\r\n\r\nPyTeaser takes any news article and extract a brief summary from it. It's based on the original [Scala](https://github.com/MojoJolo/textteaser) project.\r\n\r\n\r\nSummaries are created by ranking sentences in a news article according to how relevant they are to the entire text. The top 5 sentences are used to form a \"summary\". Each sentence is ranked by using four criteria:\r\n\r\n- Relevance to the title\r\n- Relevance to keywords in the article\r\n- Position of the sentence\r\n- Length of the sentence\r\n\r\n\r\n# Installation:\r\n\r\n```\r\npip install pyteaser\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n# Usage:\r\n## sample command:\r\n```Python\r\n>>> from pyteaser import SummarizeUrl\r\n>>> url = 'http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/11/22/twitter-forward-secrecy_n_4326599.html'\r\n>>> summaries = SummarizeUrl(url)\r\n>>> print summaries\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n## output\r\n```\r\n[\r\n  'Twitter\\'s move is the latest response from U.S. Internet firms following disclosures by former spy agency contractor Edward Snowden about widespread, classified U.S. government surveillance programs.', \r\n  'Since then, it has become clearer and clearer how important that step was to protecting our users\\' privacy.', \r\n  'The online messaging service, which began scrambling communications in 2011 using traditional HTTPS encryption, said on Friday it has added an advanced layer of protection for HTTPS known as \"forward secrecy.', \r\n  '\"A year and a half ago, Twitter was first served completely over HTTPS,\" the company said in a blog posting.', \r\n  'By Jim Finkle (Reuters) - Twitter Inc said it has implemented a security technology that makes it harder to spy on its users and called on other Internet firms to do the same, as Web providers look to thwart spying by government intelligence agencies.'\r\n]\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nyou can use Summarize(title, text) directly if you already have the text and the title. Otherwise you must install Python Goose to extract text from url.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
